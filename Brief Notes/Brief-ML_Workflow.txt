Machine Learning Workflow 
It Outlinees the steps involved in building ,evalutaing ,and deploying machine learnning model.

a)Data Collection and Preprocessing 
This step involves gathering relavent data form various sources and preparing it for modeling by cleaning ,transforming,and handling missing or inconsistent values.

b)Model Selection and Training 
Choosing the right algorithm baased on the problem statement and type ,then training the model using the prepared data to learn patterns and relationships .

c)Model evaluation and Validation
Assesing the models performance using metrics like accuracy ,precsion,recall,or RMSE, validation ensure the model generalises well ,to useen data.

d)Model Deployment and Monitoring 
Deploying the trained model into a real workd enviornment and continuosly monitoring its performance to ensure accuracy over time and retraining when necessary.
